#### freddyfishy
> An [Oh My Fish][omf-link], Fish shell theme whose name is inspired by my childhood nickname and the Fish shell of course. freddyfishy is a theme that I have borrowed some code from other themes, but have developed other myself. It has been influenced by my work as a Drupal developer and has a Drush integration.

## Install

```fish
omf install freddyfishy
```
or

```fish
fisher install topdroplabs/freddyfishy
```
for older versions of `fisher` (pre-4.0) use

```fish
fisher add topdroplabs/freddyfishy
```

You will need a [Powerline-patched font](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts) for the icons to work. Or you can enable the compatibility fallback option to use plain ASCII characters:

    set -g theme_powerline_fonts no



On Ubuntu Powerline fonts can be installed with:

```bash
sudo apt-get install fonts-powerline
```

## Features

* Left prompt
  * username
  * host
  * path
  * git status
  * For [Drupal](https://drupal.org) Developers the left prompt will show the [Drush](https://www.drush.org/) site alias name in use. -
ie. If you run `drush use @mysite` so that all commands will be sent to "@mysite", then "@mysite" will also be shown in the left prompt.
* Right prompt
  * time at the end of the last command run
  * run time of the last command
  * For those working with [Docksal](https://docksal.io) it will show the contents of the `$VIRTUAL_HOST` variable.
* If the previous command failed the line to the left of the prompt will be red instead of the normal green.
* The Fish Greetings shows an ASCII art fish and information about the terminal session.
* Battery status, which is by default shown when not plugged into AC power and not at 100% charge.
